Benchmark1 is a static frontal solution of a thermal model with ~100,000 DOF. This primarily stresses the machines hard drive.
Benchmark5 is a small contact with plasticity model which will primarily exercise the machines CPU.
Both codes have been calculated with Ansys 16.1 using Shared Memory Parallel processing with a single thread per process using 24GB of real memory and run from /data.
Further details of the process used for these benchmarks and the output data can be found on this area in GitHub.
